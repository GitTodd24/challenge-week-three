# <Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code>

## Description
A payroll manager wants an employess payroll tracker so that s/he can see employees' payroll data and properly budhget for the company. 

To date, I have completed several steps toward this objective. First, I created a function that prompts user input events. Then I created na object model to collect new employee data. After that, I created an array of employee data object models. Then I coded to return the array fo objects for display. Next, I put user data into the array, and after that, I coded to push employee data into the array. I then created a variable that will prompt the user to confirm if they would like to continue. 
I am working on a function to calculate the salary display the average salary. I learned to do much of this this week.
